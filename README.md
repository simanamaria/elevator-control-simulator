Elevator control system:

Elevator control system is a Java project that involves simulating a multi-floor building with configurable numbers of floors and elevators. The goal of the project is to implement a continuously running application using multithreading to simulate the movement of people and elevators. The project also involves collecting statistics and logging main events.

Building and Floors:
Configurable number of floors
Each floor has call buttons for "up" and "down"
People appear at random intervals and with random masses
Wanting to go to another floor

Elevators:
Configurable number of elevators
Load capacity
Speed
Door opening/closing speed
People queue up to board the elevators without disturbing the line

Multithreading:
Continuously running application
Simulating the movement of people and elevators

Statistics and Logging:
Collecting statistics
Logging main events

Note:
This project provides a simulation of a multi-floor building, elevators and people movement. The goal of the project is to simulate the elevators behavior in a multi-floor building and collect some statistics.
